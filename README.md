# BrainyJim Slack Bot

hey everyone! so i made this slack bot called BrainyJim and honestly it turned out pretty cool. basically it just shares random fun facts and has some interactive stuff like trivia games.

## what it does

- posts a daily fact at 9am (well, supposed to lol)
- you can ask for random facts using `/fact` 
- trivia games with `/trivia` - answer using the buttons
- different fact categories like animals, science, history etc
- tracks reactions on facts (thumbs up/down)
- leaderboards for trivia scores
- you can submit your own facts too

## getting it running

first install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then you need to create a slack app and get tokens:
1. go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. create new app (from scratch)
3. go to OAuth & Permissions
4. add these scopes: app_mentions:read, channels:read, chat:write, commands, users:read
5. install app to workspace
6. copy bot token (starts with xoxb-)
7. go to Socket Mode, enable it
8. generate app-level token with connections:write scope
9. copy app token (starts with xapp-)

set them as environment variables:
```bash
# windows
set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
set SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here

# linux/mac  
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here
```

run it:
```bash
python brainyjim_slack.py
```

## commands

### slash commands
- `/fact` - random fact
- `/categoryfact [category]` - fact from specific category  
- `/trivia` - trivia question (use buttons to answer)
- `/guess [number]` - number guessing game
- `/funfact [topic]` - facts about specific topics
- `/random` - completely random response
- `/leaderboard` - trivia scores
- `/mystats` - your personal stats
- `/categories` - see all available categories
- `/submitfact [fact]` - add your own fact
- `/morefacts` - loads more facts from online APIs

### regular commands  
- `!stats` - see fact statistics
- `!info` - detailed help

## notes

- the bot automatically loads facts from various APIs if it runs low
- it stores everything in a json file so data persists
- daily facts get posted to #general channel at 9am
- react with üëç/üëé on facts to rate them
- for trivia use the number emoji reactions (1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£)

the code is kinda messy but it works fine. made it over a weekend so dont judge too hard üòÖ

## deploying 24/7 for free

if you want to run this 24/7 without paying anything, here are some good options:

### railway.app (recommended)
1. push your code to github
2. go to railway.app and sign up with github
3. create new project from github repo
4. add environment variable: `DISCORD_TOKEN` with your bot token
5. it should auto-deploy

### render.com  
1. push to github
2. sign up at render.com
3. create new web service from github
4. set environment variable `DISCORD_TOKEN`
5. deploy

### fly.io
1. install flyctl cli
2. run `fly launch` in your project folder  
3. set secrets: `fly secrets set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token`
4. deploy with `fly deploy`

### other free options
- heroku alternatives like dokku
- google cloud run (free tier)
- aws lambda (might need some code changes)

most of these have free tiers that are perfect for discord bots. just make sure to set the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable on whichever platform you choose.

pro tip: railway and render are probably the easiest to set up if you're new to this stuff.
